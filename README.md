# k2450-memristor-tsp
A simple, open-source collection of measurement protocols and corresponding TSP (Lua) scripts for memristive and resistive switching devices measured with the Keithley 2450 SourceMeter.  The repository is intentionally minimal, practical, and easy to extend. Each measurement protocol is paired directly with its executable TSP code.
